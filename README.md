# PLSDA-metabolomics-modeling

Bacterial metabolomics data analyses and modeling. Data consisted of more than 3000 identified metabolites. 

Factored PCA, GMM and k-means were used for dimension reduction and clustering, as an effort to unveil the relations between samples of different treatment. 

However, PLS-DA showed superior separation of the treatments and, as an supervised method, enabled further study and prediction of the profiels.
